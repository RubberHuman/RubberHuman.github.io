            </ul>

            <p>Now, this is a lot to do, but none of this is impossible if we can work together.</p>
        </div>


        <h3 class="problem leftHead" id="sustainability">Tackling sustainability</h3>

        <div class="info">
            <p>To make agricultural farming 100% sustainable, we will have to think about how to <strong>preserve water</strong> and how we can <strong>guarantee disease-free harvests.</strong></p>
        
            <p style="border-top: 1px solid grey; padding-top: 12px;">Considering the water problem, one might think it's impossible to reduce the amount of water a plant needs to grow. Luckily though, that isn't the case.</p>

            <p>To reduce the amount of water plants need we can use Biotech/GMO Crops. Basically we would gene-edit the plants to need less water! Sounds so simple... but there's an ongoing ethical debate whether or not we should edit life itself.</p>

            <p>Of course it is good to think about things like that before we use such technology, but considering how much we'll be in a need for water and food in a couple of years, one might think we should use this technology rather sooner than later.</p>

            <p style="border-top: 1px solid grey; padding-top: 12px;">Now, guaranteeing a good, non-diseased harvest is much simpler, rigth?! Just use some good 'ol herbicides and that does the job! Welp, truth be told, it isn't just <em>that</em> easy.</p>

            <p>True, you can just spray herbicides everywhere, and that's what we've been doing. But that pollutes the environment, kills off the bees and on top of that is quite unhealthy. There'll be more about this later, but let's just say for now that herbicides can not be a permanent solution.</p>
        </div>


        <h3 class="problem rightHead" id="land">The Land Availability</h3>

        <div class="inforight">
            <p>Land availability might not be what you'ld think of when considering agricultural hindrances, but all that food has to grow somewhere!</p>

            <p>And- while it is true Climate change and soil erosion for example are harsher problems concerning productivity, it can also be quite hard to just find a piece of land to grow your crops.</p>
        
            <p>In a belgian paper concerning young farmers problems and needs, both not being able to buy and rent land were the two most complained about problems.</p>
        </div>
    

        <h3 class="problem leftHead" id="soil">Soil Erosion</h3>

        <div class="info">
            <p>Now we're getting to the heavy hitters. Let's talk soil erosion.</p>

            <p>This means we can also come back to the herbicides, here come some positive things for them: They help reduce soil erosion!</p>

            <p>It is a good thing <strong>(for the soil)</strong> tilling is reduced and replaced by herbicides. This way 80% of soil erosion can be circumvented! But, that means we <strong>have to</strong> use them.</p>

            <p><strong>Which causes problems with....</strong></p>
        </div>


        <h3 class="problem rightHead" id="biodiversity">Preserving Biodiversity</h3>

        <div class="inforight">
            <p>If we carelessly use herbicides, we will eventually wreck biodervisity killing millions of unique species. That is the case, because some substances are just poisonous to some animals! And, while damage can be minimalized, some species will always have problems because of herbicides we use.</p>

            <p>Sounds innocent enough, and who cares if some weird bugs start going extinct? Well, truth be told, those bugs build up important ecosystems and if they collapse we have problems. But much better example is the extinction of the honey bees.</p>

            <p  style="border-top: 1px solid grey; padding-top: 12px;">Now, bees pollinate plants and boost the production of certain crops by over 30% and make farming things like apples, cherries and blueberries possible. Who'ld want to give up those? But they are getting decimated by effective herbicides called Nicotinoids.</p>

            <p>Luckily some Neonicotinoids have been banned in Europe, but we have to pay attention that doesn't bumerang back at us. Farmers may resort to herbicides much more harmful to other important critters and spiders.</p>

            <p  style="border-top: 1px solid grey; padding-top: 12px;">Concluding I'ld say that a lot of work has to be done finding effective herbicedes that don't wreck biodervsity. It won't be easy, but in a Global effort, I believe we can pull through.</p>
        </div>


        <h3 class="problem leftHead" id="climate">Climate Change</h3>

        <div class="info">
            <P>Climate Change! What a joyous theme. This will not be about whether or not climate change is real, this will be about how it effects agriculture. If you need convincing that it's real, please read the NASA webpage linked above.</P>

            <p style="border-top: 1px solid grey; padding-top: 12px;">The problem with climate change and growing plants is that, well, the conditions change. And if the plants can't adapt fast enough, they will die. Now the question: How can <strong><em>we</em></strong> help the plants adapt to the harsh environments?</p>

            <p>Again, the answer lies in using Biotech/GMO Crops. Biotech/GMO Crops will be a have to in the future, with more erratic and unpredictable weather patterns coming.</p>
       
            <p>We will have to develop the most resilient of plants if we wish to continue to grow our own food.</p>
        </div>

        
        <h3 class="problem rightHead" id="population">Feeding the growing population</h3>

        <div class="inforight">
            <p>Feeding the evergrowing population of the earth was, and still is, one of the biggest challenges of Agriculture.</p>

            <p>Considering that by 2050 the world population will have surpassed <strong>9 billion</strong> we have to think about how we can improve yields and food distribution to feed everyone.</p>

            <p style="border-top: 1px solid grey; padding-top: 12px;">We, for a fact, have a surplus of food. That means we have, in theory, enough food to feed all eight billion people on the world right now. But still we see people starving in Africa.</p>

            <p>This tells us that there's a heavy imbalance in food distribution which we have to reduce. <strong>If we can accomplish this, feeding 9 billion won't be a problem.</strong></p>

            <p style="border-top: 1px solid grey; padding-top: 12px;">But, even if we can improve the food distribution, we will simply need to produce more sometime soon in the future. This can be done in many ways. But, considering that the available farm land is becoming less and less, I believe improving yields with Biotech/GMO Crops is the only sensible way.</p>

            <p>Of course again the ethical shenanigans, but if we used Biotech/GMO Crops, we could improve yields without a growing need for land.</p>
